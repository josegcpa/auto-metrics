  Image Processing and Feature Extraction:

      item_comment: >-
        Whether preprocessing of the images is appropriately performed 
        considering the imaging modality (e.g., gray level normalization for MRI,
        image registration in case of multiple contrasts or modalities) and feature
        extraction techniques (i.e., 2D or 3D) that are used. For instance, in the
        case of large slice thickness (e.g., u22655 mm), extreme upsampling (e.g.,
        1 x 1 x 1 mm3) of the volume might be inappropriate. In such a case, 2D feature
        extraction could be preferable, ensuring in-plane isotropy of the pixels.
        On the other hand, achieving isotropic voxel values should be targeted in
        3D feature extraction, to allow for texture feature rotational invariance.
        Also, whether gray level discretization parameters (bin width, along with
        resulting gray level range, or bin count) are described in full detail. Description
        of different image types used (e.g., original, filtered) should also be included
        (e.g., high and low pass filter combinations for wavelet decomposition, sigma
        values for Laplacian of Gaussian edge enhancement filtering). If the image

        Whether the training-validation-test data split is done at the
        very beginning of the analysis pipeline, prior to any processing step. Data
        split should be random but reproducible (e.g., fixed random seed), preferably
        without altering outcome variable distribution in the test set (e.g., using
        a stratified data split). Moreover, the data split should be on the patient
        level, not the scan level (i.e., different scans of the same patient should
        be in the same set). Proper data partitioning should guarantee that all data
        processing (e.g., scaling, missing value imputation, oversampling or undersampling)
        is done blinded to the test set data. These techniques should be exclusively
        fitted on training (or development) data sets and then used to transform test
        data at the time of inference. If a single training-validation data split is
        not done and a resampling technique (e.g., cross-validation) is used instead,
        test data should always be handled separately from this.

        (e.g., gender, lesion stage or grade) across sites or scanners. Be sure to focus on 
        confounders stemming from the acquisition process, such as scanner type, manufacturer,
        or scanner parameters, or from the individual patient characteristics, such as age,

        F1 score) for classification tasks; MSE, RMSE, and MAE for regression tasks.

        Use of a single imaging set (such as a single MRI sequence rather
        than multiple, or a single phase in a dynamic contrast-enhanced scan) should
        be preferred, as multi-parametric imaging may unnecessarily increase data dimensionality
        and risk of overfitting. Therefore, in the case of multi-parametric studies,
        uni-parametric evaluations should also be performed to justify the need for
        a multi-parametric approach by formally comparing their performance (e.g., DeLong's
        or McNemar's tests). This item is also intended to reward studies that experimentally
        justify the use of more complex models compared to simpler alternatives, in
        regard to input data type. Uni-parametric imaging implies the acquisition of a single 
        imaging modality, as opposed to multi-parametric imaging, which involves the acquisition of multiple 
        imaging modalities.

        Whether a non-radiomic method that is representative of the clinical practice is included
        in the analysis for comparison purposes. Non-radiomic methods might include semantic features, 
        RADS or RECIST scoring, and simple volume or size evaluations. If no non-radiomics method is available, 
        proof of improved diagnostic accuracy (e.g., improved performance of a radiologist assisted by the 
        model's output) or patient outcome (e.g., decision analysis, overall survival) should be provided. 
        In any case, the comparison should be done with an appropriate statistical method to evaluate the 
        added practical and clinical value of the model (e.g., DeLong's test for AUC comparison, decision 
        curve analysis for net benefit comparison, Net Reclassification Index). Furthermore, in case of 
        multiple comparisons, multiple testing correction methods (e.g., Bonferroni) should be considered 
        in order to reduce the false discovery rate provided that the statistical comparison is done with 
        a frequentist approach (rather than Bayesian).

        case, the comparison should be done with an appropriate statistical method (e.g.,

        in case of multiple comparisons, multiple testing correction methods (e.g.,
        Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg, or Tukey) should be considered in order to reduce
