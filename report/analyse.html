        <h1>TL;DR</h1>
        <p>It is possible — to some extent — to automate METRICS (a radiomics publication quality assessment tool) using
          large language models. You can test this <a href="https://auto-metrics.netlify.app/">here</a> with your own
          Gemini API key.</p>

      <section id="context" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p>Here we show a proof of concept on how it is possible to automate some aspects of scientific analysis. In
          particular, we will be doing this through the Methodological Radiomics Score (otherwise known as METRICS)
          <span class="citation" data-cites="Kocak2024-wk"><a href="#ref-Kocak2024-wk"
              role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>. METRICS comprises a set of helpful guidelines to determine the
          quality of a scientific publication doing some form of radiomics analysis (i.e.&nbsp;the systematic extraction
          of imaging features from clinical images and the correlation of these features with patient-specific outcomes
          or image characteristics <span class="citation" data-cites="Van_Timmeren2020-gy"><a
              href="#ref-Van_Timmeren2020-gy" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>). These sorts of scores are not new,
          with the radiomics quality score (RQS) being the other main contender for scoring radiomics <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Lambin2017-rn"><a href="#ref-Lambin2017-rn"
              role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>. Whether METRICS is more or less useful than RQS has been addressed in
          other publications and it is not the particular concern of this piece to clarify it <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Kocak2024-sv"><a href="#ref-Kocak2024-sv" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>. Instead, here we
          make use of a recent publication on the reproducibility of METRICS scores: Akinci D’Antonoli and others’
          “Reproducibility of methodological radiomics score (METRICS): an intra- and inter-rater reliability study
          endorsed by EuSoMII” <span class="citation" data-cites="Akinci-D-Antonoli2025-ep"><a
              href="#ref-Akinci-D-Antonoli2025-ep" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span>.</p>

          <p>In this work, a set of radiologists was divided into three separate experience levels — from 1 (less
            experienced) to 3 (more experienced) - based on their experience not only as radiologists but also as
            academics. Two experimental conditions were tested — no training on METRICS and with training with METRICS.
            The overall experimental design is sound and the conclusions are quite interesting: in essence, there is
            low-to-moderate inter-rater reliability, and this is particularly true when comparing between no training
            and with training <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

            Visualizing reproducibility results from Akinci D’Antonoli and others</h2>
          <p>Here we are providing only a recapitulation of what is provided as Supplementary Information 1. In
            particular, here we only use the Cohen’s Kappa to analyse how agreement varies between different conditions
            and raters. As observable in <a href="#fig-cohen-raters" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, Cohen’s
            Kappa (a measure of inter-rater agreement) is quite consistent and between 0.4 and 0.6. The one exception is
            the very high Kappa between experience level 3 (highest experience level) with and without training. This
            may highlight the effect of experience or it may be biased as the four radiologists annotated with
            experience level 3 are either editors/members of the editorial board of European Radiology (and are more
            exposed to this sort of analysis) or took part in developing METRICS (AP/AS/MK and LU, respectively); only
            three other authors are in this position of being parts of editorial teams at radiology
            journals/publications or having participated in METRICS. In any case it quite a stark difference in our
            opinion.</p>
          <p>Further analyzing how this looks for items and conditions separetely (i.e.&nbsp;calculating the average
            item-specific Cohen’s Kappa) further confirms the overall analysis as illustrated in <a
              href="#fig-cohen-raters" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> B. Finally, it is interesting to see that
            there is little agreement as far as determining the different conditions is concerned <a
              href="#fig-cohen-raters" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> C. This part is crucial as some items
            depend on specific conditions being met for grading, otherwise they are discarded.</p>

        <h1>LLMs for scientific assessment — replacement or sidekick?</h1>
        <p>Given this rich dataset — which can be easily linked to the relevant literature — we had a simple thought:
          how easily can this be performed automatically? With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there are
          ample opportunities for this. Indeed, combining LLMs with relatively deterministic structured generation can
          ensure that i) we always get the same results and ii) we always get structured results. The first can be
          achieved through 0 temperature sampling (i.e.&nbsp;no randomness given the same input) and constrained
          generation (i.e.&nbsp;the LLM can only generate tokens which force it to satisfy a set of constraints).</p>
        <p>Here, we have a concrete hypothesis: is the average agreement between an LLM and human rater groups similar
          to that which is observed between human rater groups? If so, this puts LLMs as a possible second read as far
          as METRICS assessments are concerned.</p>

You have to offer ratings to a scientific article of clinical importance at the end of this prompt according to a set of criteria.
You must answer carefully and thoughtfully, considering the context of the article and your expertise.
Be extremely thorough and conservative with your answers as these tools are supposed to be deployed in the clinic.

# Evaluation
## Metrics definition
There are 30 criteria in total and each criterion is grouped into one of 9 categories.
There are, additionally, 5 conditions which define whether some criterion should be filled or not.
The 5 Conditions are defined below under "## Conditions". A short explanation is provided for each.
The 30 criteria are defined below under "## Criteria". Each is grouped under its respective category. A short explanation is provided for each.

## Rating Rubric
No: no evidence that this criterion is being followed in this publication
Yes: evidence that this criterion is being followed in this publication
n/a: not applicable
Reason: a short explanation for each ranking

# Input format
The article text is provided below under "# Article text". Anything outside of this text should not be evaluated.

# Output format
You have to output:
- a summary of the article accurately representing the main conclusion of the article
- the answers for conditions (Yes, No) and a short explanation for your decision
- the ratings (Yes, No or n/a) for each criterion and a short explanation for your decision

## Conditions

* Condition 1: Does the study include segmentation? - "Segmentation" refers to i) Fine delineation of a region or volume of interest; ii) Rough delineation with bounding boxes; or, iii) cropping the image around a region of interest.
* Condition 2: Does the study include fully automated segmentation? - "Fully automated segmentation" refers to segmentation process without any human intervention.
* Condition 3: Does the study include hand-crafted feature extraction? - "Hand-crafted radiomic features" (i.e., traditional radiomic features) are created in advance by human experts or mathematicians.
* Condition 4: Does the study include tabular data? - "Tabular data" refers to data that is organized in a table with rows and columns (i.e., numeric radiomic features in a tabulated format, which  is usually seen in hand-crafted and some deep learning-based studies as deep features).
* Condition 5: Does the study include end-to-end deep learning? - "End-to-end deep learning" refers to the use of deep learning to directly process the image data and produce a classification or regression model.

## Criteria

### Study Design
* Item 1: Adherence to radiomics and/or machine learning-specific checklists or guidelines - Whether any guideline or checklist, e.g., CLEAR checklist, is used in designing and reporting, as appropriate for the study design (e.g., handcrafted radiomics or deep learning pipeline).
* Item 2: Eligibility criteria that describe a representative study population - Whether inclusion and exclusion criteria are explicitly defined. These should lead to a representative study sample that matches the general population of interest for the study aim.
* Item 3: High-quality reference standard with a clear definition - Whether the reference standard or outcome measure is representative of the current  clinical practice and robust. Examples of high-quality reference standards are preferably  histopathology, well-established clinical and genomic markers, the latest version of the prognostic  tools, guideline-based follow-up or consensus-based expert opinions. Examples of poor quality  reference standards are those based on qualitative image evaluation, images that are later  used for feature extraction, or outdated versions of prognostic tools.

### Imaging Data
* Item 4: Multi-center - Whether more than one institution is involved as a diagnostic imaging data source for radiomics analysis.
* Item 5: Clinical translatability of the imaging data source for radiomics analysis - Whether the source of the radiomics data is an imaging technique that reflects established standardization approaches, such as acquisition protocol guidelines (e.g., PI-RADS specifications).
* Item 6: Imaging protocol with acquisition parameters - Whether the image acquisition protocol is clearly reported to ensure the replicability of the method.
* Item 7: The interval between imaging used and reference standard - Whether the time interval between the diagnostic imaging exams (used as an input for the radiomics analysis) and the outcome measure/reference standard acquisition is appropriate to validate the presence or absence of target conditions of the radiomics analysis at the moment of the diagnostic imaging exams.

### Segmentation
* Item 8: Transparent description of segmentation methodology - Whether the rules or the method of the segmentation are defined (e.g., margin shrinkage, peri-tumoral sampling, details of segmentation regardless of whether manual, semi-automated or automated methods are used). In the case of DL-based radiomics, the segmentation can refer to the rough delineation with bounding boxes or cropping the image around a region of interest. Answer only if Condition 1 are "yes".
* Item 9: Formal evaluation of fully automated segmentation - If a segmentation technique that does not require any sort of human intervention is used, examples of the results should be presented and a formal assessment of its accuracy compared to domain expert annotations included in the study (e.g., DICE score or Jaccard index compared with a radiologist's semantic annotation). Answer only if Condition 1 and 2 are "yes".
* Item 10: Test set segmentation masks produced by a single reader or automated tool - Whether final segmentation in the test set is produced by a single reader (manually or with a semi-automated tool) or an entirely automated tool, to better reflect clinical practice. Answer only if Condition 1 are "yes".

### Image Processing and Feature Extraction
* Item 11: Appropriate use of image preprocessing techniques with transparent description - Whether preprocessing of the images is appropriately performed  considering the imaging modality (e.g., gray level normalization for MRI, image registration in case of multiple contrasts or modalities) and feature extraction techniques (i.e., 2D or 3D) that are used. For instance, in the case of large slice thickness (e.g., u22655 mm), extreme upsampling (e.g., 1 x 1 x 1 mm3) of the volume might be inappropriate. In such a case, 2D feature extraction could be preferable, ensuring in-plane isotropy of the pixels. On the other hand, achieving isotropic voxel values should be targeted in 3D feature extraction, to allow for texture feature rotational invariance. Also, whether gray level discretization parameters (bin width, along with resulting gray level range, or bin count) are described in full detail. Description of different image types used (e.g., original, filtered) should also be included (e.g., high and low pass filter combinations for wavelet decomposition, sigma values for Laplacian of Gaussian edge enhancement filtering). If the image window is fixed, it should be clarified.
* Item 12: Use of standardized feature extraction software - Whether a standardized software (e.g., compliant with IBSI) was used for feature extraction, including information on the version number. Answer only if Condition 3 are "yes".
* Item 13: Transparent reporting of feature extraction parameters, otherwise providing a default configuration statement - Whether feature types (e.g., hand-crafted, deep features) and feature classes (for hand-crafted) are described. Also, if a default configuration statement is provided for the remaining feature extraction parameters. A file presenting the complete configuration of these settings should be included in the study materials (e.g., parameter file such as in YAML format, screenshot if a dedicated file for this is not available for the software). In the case of DL, neural network architecture along with all image operations should be described.

### Feature Processing
* Item 14: Removal of non-robust features - Whether unstable features are removed via test-retest, reproducibility analysis by analysis of different segmentations, or stability analysis [i.e., image perturbations]. Instability may be due to random noise introduced by manual or even automated image segmentation or exposed in a scan-rescan setting. The specific methods used should be clearly presented, with specific results for each component in multi-step feature removal pipelines. Answer only if Condition 4 are "yes".
* Item 15: Removal of redundant features - Whether dimensionality is reduced by selecting the more informative features such as with algorithm-based feature selection (e.g., LASSO coefficients, Random Forest feature importance), univariate correlation, collinearity, or variance analysis. The specific methods used should be clearly presented, with specific results for each component in multi-step feature removal pipelines. Answer only if Condition 4 are "yes".
* Item 16: Appropriateness of dimensionality compared to data size - Whether the number of instances and features in the final training data set is appropriate according to the research question and modeling algorithm. This should be demonstrated by statistical means, empirically through consistency of performance in validation and testing, or based on previous evidence in the literature. Answer only if Condition 4 are "yes".
* Item 17: Robustness assessment of end-to-end deep learning pipelines - Whether DL pipeline consistency of performance has been assessed in a test-retest setting, for example by a scan-rescan approach, use of segmentations by different readers, or stability analysis [i.e., image perturbations]. Answer only if Condition 5 are "yes".

### Preparation for Modeling
* Item 18: Proper data partitioning process - Whether the training-validation-test data split is done at the very beginning of the analysis pipeline, prior to any processing step. Data split should be random but reproducible (e.g., fixed random seed), preferably without altering outcome variable distribution in the test set (e.g., using a stratified data split). Moreover, the data split should be on the patient level, not the scan level (i.e., different scans of the same patient should be in the same set). Proper data partitioning should guarantee that all data processing (e.g., scaling, missing value imputation, oversampling or undersampling) is done blinded to the test set data. These techniques should be exclusively fitted on training (or development) data sets and then used to transform test data at the time of inference. If a single training-validation data split is not done and a resampling technique (e.g., cross-validation) is used instead, test data should always be handled separately from this.
* Item 19: Handling of confounding factors - Whether potential confounding factors were analyzed, identified if present, and removed if necessary (e.g., if it has a strong influence on generalizability). These may include different distributions of patient characteristics (e.g., gender, lesion stage or grade) across sites or scanners.

### Metrics and Comparison
* Item 20: Use of appropriate performance evaluation metrics for task - Whether appropriate accuracy metrics are reported, such as AUC for Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) or Precision-Recall (PRC) curves and confusion matrix-derived accuracy metrics (e.g., specificity, sensitivity, precision, F1 score) for classification tasks; MSE, RMSE, and MAE for regression tasks. For classification tasks, the confusion matrix should always be included, to allow the calculation of additional metrics. If training a DL network, loss curves should be presented.
* Item 21: Consideration of uncertainty - Whether uncertainty measures are included in the analysis, such as 95% confidence interval (CI), standard deviation (SD), or standard error (SE). Report on methodology to derive that distribution (ie. bootstrapping with replacement, etc).
* Item 22: Calibration assessment - Whether the final model's calibration is assessed.
* Item 23: Use of uni-parametric imaging or proof of its inferiority - Use of a single imaging set (such as a single MRI sequence rather than multiple, or a single phase in a dynamic contrast-enhanced scan) should be preferred, as multi-parametric imaging may unnecessarily increase data dimensionality and risk of overfitting. Therefore, in the case of multi-parametric studies, uni-parametric evaluations should also be performed to justify the need for a multi-parametric approach by formally comparing their performance (e.g., DeLong's or McNemar's tests). This item is also intended to reward studies that experimentally justify the use of more complex models compared to simpler alternatives, in regard to input data type.
* Item 24: Comparison with a non-radiomic approach or proof of added clinical value - Whether a non-radiomic method that is representative of the clinical practice is included in the analysis for comparison purposes. Non-radiomic methods might include semantic features,  RADS or RECIST scoring, and simple volume or size evaluations. If no non-radiomics method is available,  proof of improved diagnostic accuracy (e.g., improved performance of a radiologist assisted by the  model's output) or patient outcome (e.g., decision analysis, overall survival) should be provided.  In any case, the comparison should be done with an appropriate statistical method to evaluate the  added practical and clinical value of the model (e.g., DeLong’s test for AUC comparison, decision  curve analysis for net benefit comparison, Net Reclassification Index). Furthermore, in case of  multiple comparisons, multiple testing correction methods (e.g., Bonferroni) should be considered  in order to reduce the false discovery rate provided that the statistical comparison is done with  a frequentist approach (rather than Bayesian).
* Item 25: Comparison with simple or classical statistical models - Whether a comparison with a simple baseline reference model (such as a Zero Rules/No Information Rate classifier) was performed. Use of machine learning methods should be justified by proof of increased performance. In any case, the comparison should be done with an appropriate statistical method (e.g., DeLong's test for AUC comparison, Net Reclassification Index). Furthermore, in case of multiple comparisons, multiple testing correction methods (e.g., Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg, or Tukey) should be considered in order to reduce the false discovery rate provided that the statistical comparison is done with a frequentist approach (rather than Bayesian).

### Testing
* Item 26: Internal testing - Whether the model is tested on an independent data set that is sampled from the same source as the training and/or validation sets.
* Item 27: External testing - Whether the model is tested with independent data from other institution(s). This also applies to the studies validating the previously published models trained at another institution.

### Open Science
* Item 28: Data availability - Whether any imaging, segmentation, clinical, or radiomics analysis data is shared with the public.
* Item 29: Code availability - Whether all scripts related to automatic segmentation and/or modeling are shared with the public. These should include clear instructions for their implementation (e.g., accompanying documentation, tutorials).
* Item 30: Model availability - Whether the final model is shared in the form of a raw model file or as a ready-to-use system. If automated segmentation was employed, the corresponding trained model should also be made available to allow replication. These should include clear instructions for their usage (e.g., accompanying documentation, tutorials).

          <p>We start by detailing some instructions that the LLM should follow. Then, we provide clear evaluation
            metrics and a rating rubric which should be followed. Finally, we declare the input format and make space
            for the actual METRICS guidelines and output format. Where we wrote <code>{article}</code>, that is where
            the text is inserted. To get these article texts we went through the articles which we could access —
            between publicly available and institutionally-accessible articles we were able to access 31 out of the
            total of 34 — and simply copied the text between the abstract (incl.) and the references (excl.) for each.
          </p>
          <p>To ensure structured outputs, we make use of a relatively strict — but simple! — data model for the output:

          <p>Upon loading, we were able to verify that all the LLM outputs have, as expected, generated a correctly
            formatted JSON. Below we present an example for one such article. Additionally, the flexibility of our
            specification also allows for a small reason to be appended to each rating — this facilitates the
            verification of LLM claims. Indeed, this explanation ends up being helpful at a later stage of this analysis
            when we start getting into possible reasons for disagreement.</p>

          <p>Upon analysis of <a href="#fig-cohen-raters-llm" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> we see quite clearly
            that, while there is some agreement between LLMs and raters, this is very much on the lower end of the
            agreement spectrum which is observed for human rater groups. Indeed, it can be risky to simply deployed this
            sans supervision. However, we note that this is still well within what would be acceptable had this been an
            additional reviewer. As noted earlier, it might be a good format to have an LLM perform these assessments as
            a second reader which ends up reinforcing some conclusions or reanalysing others.</p>

          <p>My main point of interest now was getting to know how these differences are manifested. As such, we will
            focus on cases where the number of disagreements with human raters is relatively large — in other words, we
            want to know if there are actual intuitive reasons behind LLM behavior. We consider here that agreements are
            worth 1 point, disagreements -1, and incompatibilities (i.e.&nbsp;LLM provided answer but answer for human
            raters is N/A) is 0.</p>
          <p>A main point of this analysis is for us to think through of some possible improvements that can be added to
            the description of each item to make it as clear as possible for automated assessment.</p>

            <p><em>Use of uni-parametric imaging or proof of its inferiority</em></p>
            <p>As in the table above, we can see that the average disagreement score (the average of the scoring system
              noted above) is more severe for Item23 - whether uni-parametric imaging was used or proved to be inferior
              to multi-parametric imaging. Focusing on this, we take five papers at random where all reader groups said
              “yes” while the LLM said “no”. We bring up the reasons provided by the LLM to further clarify this, and
              inspect each paper individually to better understand what the reason was. By and large, two dominant
              reasons appear to arise:</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>The LLM mistakenly assumes that using multiple image transformations during radiomic feature
                extraction counts as “multi-parametric imaging”</li>
              <li>The LLM mistakenly interprets the paper and assumes that there are other categories apart from
                “uni-parametric imaging” and “multi-parametric imaging”</li>
            </ol>
            <section id="potential-improvement" class="level4">
              <h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="potential-improvement">Potential improvement</h4>
              <p>Including the following in the item helper: “Uni-parametric imaging implies the acquisition of a single
                image for each study, as opposed to multi-parametric imaging, which involves the acquisition of multiple
                images for each study. If a study applies a radiomics-based method to multi-parametric imaging data, it
                should also apply that method to uni-parametric imaging data and compare both. If a single imaging
                modality was used, the answer should be”yes”. Examples of uni-parametric imaging include a single MRI
                sequence rather than multiple, or a single phase in a dynamic contrast-enhanced scan.”</p>

            <p><em>Comparison with a non-radiomic approach or proof of added clinical value</em></p>
            <p>Here, the main point is for raters to determine whether the radiomics-based method can improve on a
              standard approach which is more likely to be already implemented <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
            <div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container">
              <div id="fn5">
                <p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;“Whether a non-radiomic method that is representative of the clinical practice is
                  included in the analysis for comparison purposes. Non-radiomic methods might include semantic
                  features, RADS or RECIST scoring, and simple volume or size evaluations. If no non-radiomics method is
                  available, proof of improved diagnostic accuracy (e.g., improved performance of a radiologist assisted
                  by the model’s output) or patient outcome (e.g., decision analysis, overall survival) should be
                  provided. In any case, the comparison should be done with an appropriate statistical method to
                  evaluate the added practical and clinical value of the model (e.g., DeLong’s test for AUC comparison,
                  decision curve analysis for net benefit comparison, Net Reclassification Index). Furthermore, in case
                  of multiple comparisons, multiple testing correction methods (e.g., Bonferroni) should be considered
                  in order to reduce the false discovery rate provided that the statistical comparison is done with a
                  frequentist approach (rather than Bayesian).”</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>Large parts of the disagreement stem from the LLM considering that this is not the case whereas human
              raters believe this to be the case. As observed for examples 1 through four, we note that the LLM
              consistently considers models with <em>radiological</em> features as models which make use of
              <em>radiomics</em> features. This implies a deeply interesting question: is a radiological feature a
              radiomic feature? Depending on the source, radiomics can be as simple as quantitative features extracted
              from radiological images: this would place radiological features extracted by clinicians in the same field
              as radiomic features. However, we believe that the model operates under the definition that “quantitative
              radiological features” are synonyms with “radiomic features”.</p>
            <p>The 4 examples where the LLM provides a negative evaluation to an overall positive evaluation by
              radioligsts are:</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>“Development of a combined radiomics and CT feature-based model for differentiating malignant from
                benign subcentimeter solid pulmonary nodules” compares the radiomics approach with a
                clinical/radiological feature model (this clinical/radiologicl feature model included both features
                extracted manually from CT images by radiologists and sex, age, smoking history, and interval time
                between the CT scans and surgery)</li>
              <li>“Preoperative prediction of early recurrence in resectable pancreatic cancer integrating clinical,
                radiologic, and CT radiomics features” compares the radiomics-based approach with a
                clinical-radiological model</li>
              <li>“The value of LI-RADS and radiomic features from MRI for predicting microvascular invasion in
                hepatocellular carcinoma within 5 cm” compares LI-RADS (a standard radiological assessment for liver
                imaging) with radiomic features</li>
              <li>“Comparative analysis of radiomics and deep-learning algorithms for survival prediction in
                hepatocellular carcinoma” compares their radiomics/CNN-based approach with a clinical model; however and
                interestingly, the LLM recognises this but does not consider this as it does not relate to radiological
                characteristics.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Finally, contrary to most human rater/rater groups, the LLM considers that “CT radiomics to differentiate
              between Wilms tumor and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney in children” did perform a comparison with a
              non-radiomics approach, but this comparison is not direct in the publication. Indeed, in the publication,
              authors rely instead on a statistical test between groups in the training data, showing that readily
              available radiological are not sufficiently discriminative.</p>

            <p><em>Transparent description of segmentation methodology</em></p>
            <p>This item seeks to elucidate whether there is a sufficiently good description of the segmentation
              methodology <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, and the
              LLM consistently disagrees when the majority voted “no”. Here, we find that the reason stems from there
              being relatively distinct definitions of what constitutes a good description of such a methodology:
              indeed, there is always at least one rater group which considers this to be “yes”. For “CNN-based
              multi-modal radiomics analysis of pseudo-CT utilization in MRI-only brain stereotactic radiotherapy: a
              feasibility study”, 3 groups considered that there was no segmentation; this is incorrect as the study
              features CTV/OAR deliniation, despite this being only for the validation. Whether or not this counts as
              segmentation in the context of radiomics is hard to understand from current guidelines. For the remaining
              cases (where LLM considered “no” and rater groups considered “yes”):</p>

                  or automated methods are used). In the case of DL-based radiomics, the segmentation can refer to the

                resonance venography in idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients” describes the segmentation only
                as having been performed by “neuroradiologists”, which does not provide sufficient details.</li>
              <li>“Comparative analysis of radiomics and deep-learning algorithms for survival prediction in
                hepatocellular carcinoma” describes the segmentation protocol as “[a] resident with two years of

                phases using the open-source software 3D Slicer. All segmentations were verified by the same resident 4
                weeks later”; in our opinion this stands as a sufficiently transparent description of segmentation, so
                without any further details it is in our opinion hard to understand why rater groups (but not all) did
                not consider this to be the case.</li>
              <li>“Deep learning-radiomics integrated noninvasive detection of epidermal growth factor receptor

                was used and provide a link to a paper describing this. Given that the description is not available in
                this paper, we agree with the rater group majority (“no” is the correct evaluation).</li>

            <p>Here, the disagreements are, as far as we can tell, stemming from a difficulty we also face when

                id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> is somewhat hard to consider in strict terms. From our
              understanding and also based on the ratings provided by the different rater groups, we assume that the
              confounders should be associated with acquisition parameters or with patient characteristics.</p>

                “Prediction of SBRT response in liver cancer by combining original and delta cone-beam CT radiomics: a
                pilot study”, the authors do not control for confounders. However, they analyse how pre-SBRT therapy is

              <li>Cases where the LLM considers a “no” for Item19 while the majority of rater groups consider a “yes”
                stem from ambiguity in what controlling for confounders can be. For instance, in “The value of LI-RADS
                and radiomic features from MRI for predicting microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma within
                5 cm”, the authors include potential confounders into the model (mostly clinical and demographic
                variables), leading raters to largely consider a “yes” for Item19. However, no post-hoc analysis is
                performed, nor is an explicit analysis of the impact of confounders, leading the LLM to consider a “no”
                for Item19.</li>

            <p>Upon the analysis above, we use the same LLM with the data and the improved descriptions injected into
              the prompt. While not ideal, this will allow us to see — to a very limited extent as we are lacking an
              external validation — whether this can lead to an improvement. As highlighted in <a
                href="#fig-cohen-raters-llm-improved" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a> it is possible to see no
              improvements, hinting that these sorts of analysis may benefit from more refined prompt improvement
              methods. <a href="#fig-cohen-raters-conditions-llm-improved-subset" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>,
              specific for the eight items above, shows that there are no systematic improvements. Additionally, an
              interesting effect non-linear effect here is that while the condition prompts where not altered, there was
              a notable improvement to the agreement between LLM and human rater groups for conditions.</p>

            Analysing whether radiomic scores are similar between different rater groups and LLMs</h2>
          <p>Finally, we consider the final quantity of METRICS (i.e.&nbsp;a single score between 0 and 1 which
            quantifies how much a manuscript follows this rating). We can see that LLM-based assessments tend to
            over-estimate scores when relative to some readers (<strong>?@fig-corr-matrix</strong>). However, when
            measuring correlations between all human rater groups and between LLMs and all human rater groups, these are
            relatively similar, hinting that there is similar variability between other reader groups
            (<strong>?@fig-corr-matrix</strong>). Mean absolute errors are also not particularly higher than others
            (<strong>?@fig-corr-matrix</strong>).</p>

          <h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="validation-of-llm-observations-above-with-kocak-et.-al-2025">Validation
            of LLM observations above with <em>Kocak et. al (2025)</em></h2>
          <p>Around the time we were developing this, Kocak and others published “Radiomics for differentiating
            radiation-induced brain injury from recurrence in gliomas: systematic review, meta-analysis, and
            methodological quality evaluation using METRICS and RQS” in European Radiology <span class="citation"
              data-cites="Kocak2025-uj"><a href="#ref-Kocak2025-uj" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>. Here, three
            different raters (identified as raters 1-3) were tasked with classifying 27 papers using METRICS. Here, we
            provide LLM-based METRICS scores for only 22 as the remaining 5 were behind a paywall. It should be noted
            that the first author (and one of the raters as far we understand it) in <em>Kocak et al.&nbsp;(2025)</em>
            was also a co-author in <span class="citation" data-cites="Akinci-D-Antonoli2025-ep"><a
                href="#ref-Akinci-D-Antonoli2025-ep" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span> and the first author of the
            original METRICS definition paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Kocak2024-wk"><a
                href="#ref-Kocak2024-wk" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>.</p>
          <p>As visible below across <a href="#fig-cohen-kocak" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11</a>, the inter-rater
            agreements are relatively stable between readers and between readers and LLMs. An interesting outcome of
            this is that the LLM + changes do not lead to such stark improvements as before, hinting that
            dataset-specific prompt tuning may not be the best way of improving scores across multiple publications.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion and where to go from here</h1>
        <p>This was a somewhat quick analysis prompted by a concrete question — can we facilitate what are oftentimes
          cumbersome analyses by getting the assistance of an LLM? The answer to this — at least what this analysis
          shows — is that:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>There is a reasonable amount of agreement between LLMs and human rater groups, but there is also a
            reasonable amount of differences between human rater groups and LLMs. This is not absurd as this system in
            particular — METRICS — relies quite heavily on expert knowledge. The paper that originated this short report
            highlights, to an extent, the differences in subjective evaluation associated with human raters <span
              class="citation" data-cites="Akinci-D-Antonoli2025-ep"><a href="#ref-Akinci-D-Antonoli2025-ep"
                role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span>. While more objective, LLM-based assessments may end up being too
            different. However, our confirmation using <span class="citation" data-cites="Kocak2025-uj"><a
                href="#ref-Kocak2025-uj" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span> does show that these findings — that there
            is a good number of similarities between human raters and LLMs — generalise to other datasets.</li>
          <li>Improvements are possible from relatively simple analyses which place the human in the loop, suggesting
            that more data and further optimization can lead to a robust automated METRICS assessment system. While
            automated prompt engineering could be an alternative, there is a significant amount of work which goes into
            the annotation of these manuscripts, making these approaches — which require a good number of examples —
            quite tricky to handle when sample sizes are small. Our analysis on <span class="citation"
              data-cites="Kocak2025-uj"><a href="#ref-Kocak2025-uj" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span> showed that
            prompt tuning using small sample sizes is likely to result in observable but limited improvements However,
            both the tuning and its validation used relatively small dataset sizes. Perhaps automatic prompt tuning can
            improve this.</li>
          <li>Open LLMs can pave the way for a more privacy-preserving way of using Auto-METRICS. Phi4-Reasoning, in
            particular, is remarkably powerful at this, out-ranking Gemini Flash 2.0. The only drawback is in terms of
            compute access (not everyone has access to a GPU) and time - this solutions takes significantly longer (a
            little over 10 seconds becomes over 2 minutes on average).</li>
